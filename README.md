# Dost
Dost : a python project which responds to commands vocal/text and performs them in its capacity.

Basically, it's a short and crisp version of what google assistant can do. You can ask it to play a song, search the web, read bio of a person from wikipedia, etc.
While giving commands, try using the keywords.

To run this program, run the main.py file in your editor.
